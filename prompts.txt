1. I want to create an AI chatbot using langchain and gemini.
The app should look beautiful and modern.
Create all the folders and files as necessary.

Techstack:
- Html, css, javascript, react, vite
- Python, FastAPI, langchain
###############


The content of the chat.py file is not correct.  It should give me the complete code for the chat feature, it should be a chat application whre a user can interact with an ai chatbot. Use langchan framework and google gemini model


2. I have the backend ready for the chatbot application. Create an UI that Looks similar to the image I provided, and connect to this backend application. 

The application should be ready to use. I have given you the folder structure for the frontend as well. Do it accordingly. Create more files whenever required.
